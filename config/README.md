This is where configurations are stored.   

Most important ones when getting started are **serverlist** and **pluginurls.csv**.

**serverlist** is a simple list with each server's name and memory allocation in MB.

**pluginurls.csv** stores each of your plugin titles, sources and URLs.   This is referenced when running **./mc update plugins**.
