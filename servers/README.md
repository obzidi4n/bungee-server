Each of your Spigot servers gets a subdirectory here, all managed by the Bungeecord proxy in the **bungee** directory.

Set up your server names and memory allocations in **bungee-server/config/serverlist**

Always keep a **bungee** subdirectory here (for obvious reasons) as well as a **test** subdirectory, and set up your Bungee configs accordingly.
